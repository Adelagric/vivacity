# Notices

vivacity is distributed under the MIT or Apache-2.0 license, at your option
(see LICENSE-MIT and LICENSE-APACHE). It reimplements the behaviour of
Composer, and parts of it are ports — function by function — of the
following software. Their source files are vendored in `docs/reference/`
as the reference each port is checked against (the copies come from the
Composer 2.10.3 phar, which strips comment headers; the license texts are
kept next to them). The copyright notices below apply to those files and
to the Rust code ported from them.

The PHP sources under `docs/reference/` are not part of the compiled
crates; they are kept so that `harness/drift-reference.sh` can re-diff
them against the phar and name the port that must be re-read when
upstream moves.

Nothing is ported from GPL-licensed software. Releases 0.3.0 to 0.5.0
shipped an emulation of `drupal/core-composer-scaffold` (GPL-2.0-or-later)
ported from its source; it was removed in 0.6.0 for that reason, and the
`vivace*` crates were deleted from crates.io (only 0.5.0 had been published).
