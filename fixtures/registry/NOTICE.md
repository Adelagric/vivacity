# Frozen Packagist snapshots

One archive per fixture, produced by `tools/snapshot-packagist.sh`: every
`p2/<vendor>/<name>[~dev].json` file Composer loaded while resolving the
fixture's manifest (its own cache after a `composer update --no-install` with
an empty cache), the reference `composer.lock.expected` Composer wrote from
live Packagist at that moment, and a `SNAPSHOT` file with the date, the
Composer version and the virtual package names (404 on Packagist, stubbed as
"no versions" because a missing file is fatal over `file://`).

`harness/update.sh` unpacks an archive, points both Composer and vivacity at it
through the global config (`COMPOSER_HOME/config.json`, so `composer.json`
stays byte-identical and its content-hash counts), and compares the locks.
The metadata is public Packagist data (package manifests published by their
authors); it is test data, not part of vivacity. `wordpress` has no snapshot:
wpackagist speaks the Composer v1 provider protocol, out of scope for the
resolver.

The `solver-*` archives back the manifests in `fixtures/projects/solver-*`:
small cases written for the solver oracle (`tests/oracle_pool.rs`) —
backtracking, an unsolvable set (no reference lock, `unsolvable` in
`SNAPSHOT`), root aliases on dev branches, virtual packages with several
providers, blocking policies, dev branches held at their lock entry through
their branch alias in a partial update. They are resolved by `tools/oracle-pool.php --solve` and by
vivacity on the same snapshot; the decision sequences must be identical.

`path-repos` has no Packagist metadata at all (`p2/` is empty, Packagist is
disabled in the manifest): the archive only carries the reference lock so
`harness/update.sh` treats the fixture like the others.
